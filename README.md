# Background
I optimized these dotfiles for my laptop, an HP Elitebook 8440p. There are more directories at the original repo.

# Instructions

First, clone this repo into your user's home directory (/home/yourusername), then cd into dots-master. Next, install all the packages mentioned above, plus stow. Then use stow to basically copy the configs from the git repo into ".config/" in your home directory. 

So if I wanted to install the rofi and waybar configuration files, I would type in "**stow rofi waybar**".

# Closing

Thanks for checking this out!
