# Background
I optimized these dotfiles for my laptop, an HP Elitebook 8440p. However, I have deleted some directories that I have deemed not important for me, such as NeoVim and Alacritty configuration files. If you would like the original folders, files, and more, I would highly encourage you to visit the original repo.

# Instructions

To use these configurations, you need to enter the configuration file for the program you want to customize, and copy the settings over from the file on Github with the same name, to your configuration file.
(So for example, if I wanted to edit the Sway configuration file, I would use my text editor of choice, and go to ~/.config/sway/config. On GitHub, I will go to the _/sway/.config/sway_ directory, and press the "config" file. I would then copy paste whatever settings I would like to my sway config file.)
I would highly encourage you _not_ to copy paste everything, especially if you do not have a US keyboard layout, or a 1366x768 screen. But feel free to suggest edits or fork this repo to optimize it for your hardware.
